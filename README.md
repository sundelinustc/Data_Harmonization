# Data_Harmonization
Results of neuroimaging datasets aggregated from multiple sites may be biased by site-specific profiles in participantsâ€™ demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as MRI acquisition protocols and scanning platforms. We compared the impact of four different harmonization methods on results of analyses of cortical thickness data derived from brain MRI: a linear mixed-effects model (LME) that models site-specific random intercepts (LMEINT), an LME that models both site-specific random intercepts and age-related random slopes (LMEINT+SLP), ComBat, and ComBat with a generalized additive model (ComBat-GAM). Our test case for comparing harmonization methods was cortical thickness data aggregated from 29 sites grouped into cases with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (N=1,344) and controls without PTSD who were exposed to trauma (N=2,073). We found that, compared to the other data harmonization methods, results from data processed with ComBat-GAM were more sensitive for detecting regions showing significant case-control differences in cortical thickness, and case-control differences in age-related cortical thinning. Use of ComBat-GAM led to larger estimates of cortical thickness reductions, smaller age-appropriate declines and lower female to male contrast in cases compared to controls. Normalization with ComBat-GAM also led to greater estimates of age-related declines in cortical thickness in both cases and controls. Our results support the use of ComBat-GAM for harmonizing cortical thickness data aggregated from multiple sites and platforms to minimize confounds and increase statistical power.
